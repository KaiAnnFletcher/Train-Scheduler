**IMPORTANT**

Add the names of trains and their times to the scheduler (i.e. the section that is titled "*Add Train*"). Simply fill out the form by inputting the required information and that's it! 

Hit "*Submit*" once the form is comlete. The time calculations are already accounted for using moment.js.

**FEATURES REQUIRING FUTURE IMPROVEMENTS**

* The scroll mechanism in the Train Scheduler container.

* Clearing the form afer entering the information.

**FEATURE REQUESTS**

* Consider updating "minutes to arrival" and "next train time" text once every minute. 

* Try adding update and remove buttons for each train. Let the user edit the row's elements-- allow them to change a train's Name, Destination and Arrival Time (and then, by relation, minutes to arrival). 

* Make it so that only users who log into the site with their Google or GitHub accounts can use the site.
